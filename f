# ElixirScope Foundation Integration Fixes

ElixirScope is an **AST-based debugging and code intelligence platform** for Elixir applications. It provides visibility into Elixir applications by combining **static code analysis, runtime correlation, and AI-powered insights**.

---

### Key Features

* **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Large Language Model (LLM) integration for intelligent code insights and recommendations.
* **AST-Aware Debugging**: Offers deep code structure understanding for precise debugging.
* **Code Property Graphs (CPG)**: Enables advanced graph-based code analysis and visualization.
* **Runtime Correlation**: Connects static analysis with live execution data.
* **Architectural Intelligence**: Detects code patterns, smells, and optimization opportunities.
* **Time-Travel Debugging**: Allows stepping backward through execution history.
* **Performance Insights**: Identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
* **Live Code Intelligence**: Provides real-time analysis during coding.

### Architecture

ElixirScope uses a **9-layer architecture** for modularity, maintainability, and extensibility:

1.  **Debugger**: Complete debugging interface.
2.  **Intelligence**: AI/ML integration.
3.  **Capture**: Runtime correlation and querying.
4.  **Analysis**: Architectural analysis.
5.  **CPG**: Code Property Graph.
6.  **Graph**: Graph algorithms.
7.  **AST**: AST parsing and repository.
8.  **Foundation**: Core utilities.

### Installation and Usage

To install ElixirScope, add `{:elixir_scope, "~> 0.2.0"}` to your `mix.exs` dependencies.

**Basic Usage:**

```elixir
# Start ElixirScope
{:ok, _} = ElixirScope.start_link()

# Analyze a module
{:ok, analysis} = ElixirScope.analyze_module(MyApp.SomeModule)

# Start a debugging session
{:ok, session_id} = ElixirScope.start_debug_session(MyApp.SomeModule, :some_function, [arg1, arg2])

# Get AI-powered insights
{:ok, insights} = ElixirScope.get_ai_insights(analysis)
```

**Configuration:**

Configure ElixirScope in your `config.exs` to set up AI providers, analysis options, capture settings, and debugger behavior.

### AI Integration

ElixirScope integrates with AI providers like **OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google (Gemini Pro)**. It uses AI for **code analysis, debugging assistance, pattern recognition, performance optimization, and documentation generation**.

Based on comprehensive testing, 6 critical integration gaps were discovered that need immediate fixes:

1. **Config Event Emission Missing**: ConfigServer doesn't emit events on successful updates
2. **Telemetry Auto-Collection Missing**: EventStore doesn't report metrics to TelemetryService
3. **Service API Inconsistency**: `ConfigServer.do_initialize/1` doesn't exist (should use `initialize/0`)
4. **Task API Error**: Using non-existent `Task.await_all/2` (should be `Task.await_many/2`)
5. **Event Parent-Child Logic Broken**: Parent ID assignment incorrect for sequential events
6. **Service Restart Timing Issues**: Services restart too quickly for failure simulation

Fix these integration gaps systematically:
- Make ConfigServer emit events on config updates
- Wire EventStore operations to telemetry metrics
- Standardize service initialization APIs
- Fix Task API usage in concurrent operations
- Implement proper parent-child event ID relationships
- Add proper service coordination timing

Maintain enterprise-grade standards per STANDARDS.md throughout all fixes.

First, use mcp context7 to read the Elixir docs, and use those latest standards for our project. Use context7 as needed for elixir documentation.
