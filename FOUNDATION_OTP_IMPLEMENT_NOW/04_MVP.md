# ElixirScope PRD: BEAM Compile-Time Instrumentation & AI-Powered Debugging

## **Product Vision**
A compile-time code instrumentation system that seamlessly hooks into the BEAM compilation process to provide real-time debugging insights enhanced by AI analysis. Transform Elixir development by making invisible runtime behavior visible and actionable.

## **Core Problem**
Elixir developers struggle with:
- **Opaque Runtime Behavior**: Process crashes, message passing, and state mutations happen in black boxes
- **Ineffective Debugging**: Traditional debuggers break OTP supervision trees and message flow
- **Manual Error Analysis**: Developers manually correlate logs, traces, and error reports
- **Compilation Blindness**: No insight into compile-time warnings, optimizations, or AST transformations

## **Solution Overview**
A **compile-time instrumentation framework** that:
1. **Hooks into compilation** to instrument code automatically
2. **Maintains stateful debugging processes** alongside your application
3. **Captures BEAM-specific events** (process lifecycle, message passing, supervisor actions)
4. **Integrates with AI** to provide intelligent debugging insights

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Core Components**

#### **1. Compilation Hook System**
```elixir
# Compiler plugin that instruments code during compilation
defmodule ElixirScope.CompilerHook do
  @behaviour :compile.plugin
  
  # Hooks into Elixir's compilation pipeline
  def transform_ast(ast, _opts) do
    ast
    |> instrument_function_calls()
    |> instrument_process_spawns()
    |> instrument_message_sends()
    |> add_debugging_metadata()
  end
end
```

#### **2. Runtime Instrumentation Process**
```elixir
# Stateful process that manages debugging state
defmodule ElixirScope.InstrumentationServer do
  use GenServer
  
  # Captures all instrumented events in real-time
  # Maintains process topology, message flow graphs
  # Correlates compile-time and runtime information
end
```

#### **3. BEAM Event Capture**
```elixir
# Low-level hooks into BEAM internals
defmodule ElixirScope.BeamHooks do
  # Process lifecycle events (:proc_lib, :supervisor events)
  # Error logger integration (Logger, :error_logger)
  # Memory/scheduler monitoring
  # Distribution events (node connections, message routing)
end
```

#### **4. AI Analysis Engine**
```elixir
# LLM integration for intelligent debugging
defmodule ElixirScope.AIAnalyzer do
  # Pattern recognition in error sequences
  # Code smell detection from AST analysis
  # Debugging suggestion generation
  # Performance bottleneck identification
end
```

## **Functional Requirements**

### **FR1: Seamless Compilation Integration**
- **Hook into `mix compile`** without breaking existing build processes
- **Zero runtime overhead** when instrumentation is disabled
- **Selective instrumentation** - only instrument specific modules/functions
- **Preserve original compilation errors/warnings** while adding insights

### **FR2: Real-Time Process Visualization**
- **Live process topology**: See supervision trees, worker processes, message flows
- **Message tracing**: Track messages between processes with timing and content
- **State evolution**: Watch GenServer state changes over time
- **Crash correlation**: Link process crashes to their impact on the system

### **FR3: Intelligent Error Analysis**
- **Error pattern detection**: "This crash pattern indicates a resource leak"
- **Fix suggestions**: "Consider adding a timeout to this GenServer call"
- **Code quality insights**: "This function has high cyclomatic complexity"
- **Performance recommendations**: "This process is a bottleneck - consider pooling"

### **FR4: Compilation Insight Dashboard**
- **AST diff visualization**: See how macros transform your code
- **Compile-time warnings with context**: Enhanced warning messages with suggestions
- **Dependency analysis**: Understand compile-time dependencies and circular references
- **Build performance**: Identify slow compilation bottlenecks

## **Key Architectural Decisions**

### **1. Compilation vs Runtime Instrumentation**
**Decision**: Hybrid approach - compile-time code transformation + runtime event capture
**Rationale**: 
- Compile-time gives us AST access and zero runtime overhead for disabled features
- Runtime gives us dynamic behavior insights and stateful debugging

### **2. Infrastructure Complexity**
**Decision**: Minimal infrastructure for core debugging use case
**Rationale**:
- Rate limiting: Simple per-process limits (avoid overwhelming debugging UI)
- Connection pooling: Only for external AI API calls
- Circuit breakers: Only for AI service integration
- **Focus on debugging-specific infrastructure needs**

### **3. AST vs CPG Analysis**
**Decision**: Start with AST, evaluate CPG later
**Rationale**:
- AST provides sufficient information for most debugging use cases
- CPG adds complexity that may not be needed initially
- Can add CPG in Phase 4 if analysis shows benefit

### **4. BEAM Integration Strategy**
**Decision**: Use official BEAM APIs where possible, careful low-level hooks where needed
**Rationale**:
- Stability and forward compatibility
- Easier maintenance and debugging
- Avoid breaking changes in BEAM internals

## **Infrastructure Needs Analysis**

### **Actually Needed Infrastructure**
```elixir
# For debugging tool use case:
✅ Rate Limiting: Prevent debug event flooding
✅ Connection Pooling: AI API calls, external tool integration  
❌ Circuit Breakers: Overkill for debugging tool
❌ Complex event processing: Simple event capture sufficient
❌ Distributed consensus: Not needed for debugging
```

### **Simplified Infrastructure Stack**
```elixir
# Minimal viable infrastructure:
1. Simple rate limiting (prevent debug spam)
2. AI API connection pooling (OpenAI, etc.)
3. Basic error handling and retry logic
4. File-based persistence for debugging sessions
5. Simple web interface for visualization
```

### **Foundation Services Relevance**
```elixir
# Relevant to debugging tool:
✅ ConfigServer: Manage instrumentation settings
✅ EventStore: Store debugging events and sessions
❌ Advanced performance monitoring: Built into debugging tool
❌ Complex health checking: Not needed for development tool
```

## **Prototype Scope**

**MVP Features for Revolutionary Debugging Demo**:
1. **Automatic function tracing** with zero setup
2. **Live process visualization** showing supervision trees
3. **AI-powered error analysis** with specific fix suggestions
4. **Message flow tracking** between processes
5. **One-command setup**: `mix scope.debug` starts everything

**Demo Story**: 
*"Watch as ElixirScope automatically instruments your GenServer, shows you exactly why it's crashing, traces the message that caused the problem, and suggests the precise code fix - all while your application keeps running normally."*

This PRD focuses on the **core value proposition** - revolutionary debugging for Elixir - while acknowledging that the complex infrastructure you've designed may be overkill for this specific use case. The debugging tool needs smart, lightweight infrastructure that serves the debugging workflow, not enterprise-grade distributed systems architecture.
