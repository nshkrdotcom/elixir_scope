# Graph Algorithms Extracted from CPG

The graph algorithms were embedded in the CPG builder core.
These need to be extracted and refactored into pure graph algorithms:

1. Centrality calculations
2. Pathfinding algorithms  
3. Community detection
4. Connectivity analysis

Source files to extract from:
- ast_repository/enhanced/cpg_builder/core.ex
- ast_repository/enhanced/cpg_builder/graph_merger.ex
- Any other CPG files with graph algorithm logic

TODO: Refactor these into pure mathematical graph operations.
