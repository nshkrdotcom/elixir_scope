# ORIG_FILE
defmodule ElixirScope.Capture.Runtime.InstrumentationRuntime do
  @moduledoc """
  Main runtime API for instrumented code to report events to ElixirScope.

  This module provides the primary interface that AST-transformed code will call.
  It delegates to specialized modules for different concerns while maintaining
  the same public API for backward compatibility.

  Key design principles:
  - Minimal overhead when disabled (single boolean check)
  - No crashes if ElixirScope is not running
  - Efficient correlation ID management
  - Support for nested function calls

  ## Module Breakdown

  ### InstrumentationRuntime (Main Module)
  ```elixir
  # Acts as a facade, delegating to specialized modules
  defdelegate report_function_entry(module, function, args), to: CoreReporting
  defdelegate report_phoenix_request_start(correlation_id, method, path, params, remote_ip), to: PhoenixReporting
  ```

  **Purpose**: Maintains the public API and delegates to appropriate specialized modules.

  ### Context Module
  ```elixir
  alias ElixirScope.Capture.Runtime.InstrumentationRuntime.Context

  Context.initialize_context()
  Context.enabled?()
  Context.current_correlation_id()
  ```

  **Purpose**: Manages process-level instrumentation state, correlation IDs, and call stacks.

  ### CoreReporting Module
  ```elixir
  alias ElixirScope.Capture.Runtime.InstrumentationRuntime.CoreReporting

  CoreReporting.report_function_entry(MyModule, :my_function, [arg1, arg2])
  CoreReporting.report_process_spawn(child_pid)
  ```

  **Purpose**: Handles basic instrumentation events like function calls, process spawns, and errors.

  ### ASTReporting Module
  ```elixir
  alias ElixirScope.Capture.Runtime.InstrumentationRuntime.ASTReporting

  ASTReporting.report_ast_variable_snapshot(correlation_id, variables, line, ast_node_id)
  ASTReporting.report_ast_expression_value(correlation_id, expression, value, line, ast_node_id)
  ```

  **Purpose**: Handles AST transformation-specific events with enhanced correlation features.

  ### PhoenixReporting Module
  ```elixir
  alias ElixirScope.Capture.Runtime.InstrumentationRuntime.PhoenixReporting

  PhoenixReporting.report_phoenix_request_start(correlation_id, method, path, params, remote_ip)
  PhoenixReporting.report_liveview_handle_event_start(correlation_id, event, params, socket_assigns)
  ```

  **Purpose**: Handles Phoenix framework events including HTTP requests, LiveView, and channels.

  ### For New Code
  You can choose to use either approach:

  ```elixir
  # Option 1: Use the main module (recommended for public API)
  alias ElixirScope.Capture.Runtime.InstrumentationRuntime, as: Runtime
  Runtime.report_function_entry(MyModule, :my_func, [])

  # Option 2: Use specific modules directly (for internal/specialized use)
  alias ElixirScope.Capture.Runtime.InstrumentationRuntime.CoreReporting
  CoreReporting.report_function_entry(MyModule, :my_func, [])
  ```

  ## Testing Strategy

  ### Module-Level Testing
  Each module can now be tested independently:

  ```elixir
  defmodule InstrumentationRuntime.CoreReportingTest do
    use ExUnit.Case
    alias ElixirScope.Capture.Runtime.InstrumentationRuntime.CoreReporting

    test "reports function entry when enabled" do
      # Test only CoreReporting logic without Phoenix/Ecto dependencies
    end
  end
  ```

  ### Integration Testing
  The main module tests ensure all delegations work correctly:

  ```elixir
  defmodule InstrumentationRuntimeTest do
    use ExUnit.Case
    alias ElixirScope.Capture.Runtime.InstrumentationRuntime

    test "delegates function entry to CoreReporting" do
      # Test that the facade properly delegates to sub-modules
    end
  end
  ```
