## Functional Requirements

- [ ] Provide file change event filtering and validation

### FR-5.2: Incremental AST Updates
**Priority**: MUST  
**Description**: System MUST perform incremental AST updates on file changes  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Parse only changed files, not entire project
- [ ] Update repository data structures atomically
- [ ] Maintain correlation mappings during incremental updates
- [ ] Invalidate affected caches and pattern analysis results
- [ ] Support rollback on parsing failures

### FR-5.3: Dependency-Aware Updates
**Priority**: MUST  
**Description**: System MUST handle dependency cascades during updates  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Identify modules affected by changed dependencies
- [ ] Re-analyze dependent modules when dependencies change
- [ ] Update cross-module analysis results incrementally
- [ ] Maintain dependency graph consistency
- [ ] Support transitive dependency update propagation

### FR-5.4: Real-Time Synchronization Coordination
**Priority**: MUST  
**Description**: System MUST coordinate real-time updates with ongoing analysis  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Coordinate with pattern matching engine during updates
- [ ] Manage concurrent access during synchronization
- [ ] Provide synchronization status and progress reporting
- [ ] Handle conflicts between batch analysis and incremental updates
- [ ] Support pause/resume of file watching

### FR-5.5: Performance-Optimized File Watching
**Priority**: SHOULD  
**Description**: System SHOULD optimize file watching for minimal performance impact  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Minimal CPU usage during idle periods (< 1%)
- [ ] Efficient file system event processing
- [ ] Configurable update batching and throttling
- [ ] Memory-efficient event queue management
- [ ] Support for large codebases without performance degradation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-5.1: Real-Time Performance
- **File change detection**: < 500ms from file save to detection
- **Incremental parsing**: < 2 seconds for typical module updates
- **Dependency updates**: < 5 seconds for cascading updates
- **Memory overhead**: < 10MB for file watching infrastructure

### NFR-5.2: System Reliability
- **Uptime**: 99.9% file watching availability
- **Error recovery**: Automatic recovery from file system errors
- **Data consistency**: Zero data corruption during concurrent updates
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallback to polling if native watching fails

### NFR-5.3: Resource Efficiency
- **CPU usage**: < 2% during normal file operations
- **Memory usage**: Linear growth with watched file count
- **I/O efficiency**: Minimal file system polling overhead
- **Network impact**: No network dependency for local file watching

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Priority Refactoring: file_watcher.ex (28K LOC)
The existing `file_watcher.ex` is the largest file in the AST layer and requires complete refactoring:

#### Extract into focused modules:
- [ ] `lib/elixir_scope/ast/repository/synchronization/file_watcher/core.ex` (estimated: 400 LOC)
  - Core file watching logic and initialization
  - Event loop management and coordination

- [ ] `lib/elixir_scope/ast/repository/synchronization/file_watcher/event_handler.ex` (estimated: 500 LOC)
  - File system event processing
  - Event filtering and validation
  - Event debouncing and throttling

- [ ] `lib/elixir_scope/ast/repository/synchronization/file_watcher/dependency_tracker.ex` (estimated: 400 LOC)
  - Module dependency tracking
  - Cascade update management
  - Dependency graph maintenance

- [ ] `lib/elixir_scope/ast/repository/synchronization/file_watcher/update_coordinator.ex` (estimated: 300 LOC)
  - Incremental update coordination
  - Repository synchronization
  - Concurrent access management

- [ ] `lib/elixir_scope/ast/repository/synchronization/file_watcher/performance_monitor.ex` (estimated: 200 LOC)
  - Performance monitoring and optimization
  - Resource usage tracking
  - Bottleneck identification

#### Additional Implementation Files:
- [ ] `lib/elixir_scope/ast/repository/synchronization/synchronizer.ex` (enhance existing)
  - Main synchronization orchestrator
  - Integration with file watcher components
  - Status reporting and control

- [ ] `lib/elixir_scope/ast/repository/synchronization/incremental_updater.ex` (estimated: 300 LOC)
  - Incremental AST update logic
  - Repository update coordination
  - Cache invalidation management

### Integration Architecture
```elixir
# File change processing pipeline
def handle_file_change(file_path, change_type) do
  file_path
  |> validate_file_change(change_type)
  |> parse_if_needed()
  |> identify_dependencies()
  |> update_repository()
  |> invalidate_caches()
  |> notify_observers()
end
```
