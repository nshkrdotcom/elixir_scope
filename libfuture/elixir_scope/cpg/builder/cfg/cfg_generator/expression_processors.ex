defmodule ElixirScope.AST.Enhanced.CFGGenerator.ExpressionProcessors do
  @moduledoc """
  Main entry point for expression, assignment, and other non-control-flow construct processors.
  Delegates to specialized processor modules.

  Phase 2: Gradual Direct Usage (Optional)

  # Instead of:
  ```elixir
  ExpressionProcessors.process_assignment(pattern, expr, meta, state)
  ```

  # You can now use directly:
  ```elixir
  AssignmentProcessors.process_assignment(pattern, expr, meta, state)
  ```

  Phase 3: Module-Specific Imports (Optional)

  # Import only what you need
  ```elixir
  alias ElixirScope.AST.Enhanced.CFGGenerator.ExpressionProcessors.{
    BasicProcessors,
    FunctionProcessors
  }
  ```
