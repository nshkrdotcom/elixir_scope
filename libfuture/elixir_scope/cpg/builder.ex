defmodule ElixirScope.AST.Enhanced.CPGBuilder do
  @moduledoc """
  Code Property Graph builder for comprehensive AST analysis.

  Combines Control Flow Graphs (CFG) and Data Flow Graphs (DFG) into a unified
  representation that enables advanced analysis including:
  - Security vulnerability detection
  - Code quality analysis and metrics
  - Performance bottleneck identification
  - Pattern matching for code analysis
  - Cross-function dependency analysis

  Performance targets:
  - CPG building: <500ms for modules with <50 functions
  - Memory efficient: <5MB per module CPG

  This module serves as the main interface and delegates to specialized
  sub-modules for different aspects of CPG building and analysis.
