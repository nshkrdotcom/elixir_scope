Okay, this is a fantastic setup and a very common, important challenge: how to maintain velocity and stability in a large, evolving system *before* you've locked down all interfaces and can write comprehensive, formal test suites.

Your `DEV.MD` and `STATIC_DYNAMIC_CORRELATOR.MD` are excellent starting points and show a strong architectural vision. The goal is to prevent "architectural drift" and ensure that changes, even exploratory ones, don't destabilize the core.

Here's a proposed approach, blending patterns, techniques, and tools, tailored to your Elixir context and the desire to avoid premature formalization of tests:

## Guiding Principles for Evolving Stability

1.  **Clarity over Premature Concreteness:** Focus on making intent and boundaries clear, even if implementations are still fluid.
2.  **Fast Feedback (Cheapest First):** Leverage Elixir's compiler, REPL, and lightweight checks before heavier testing.
3.  **Isolate Volatility:** Allow parts of the system to be experimental while keeping established parts stable.
4.  **Progressive Formalization:** Start with informal checks and gradually introduce more formal tests as designs solidify.

## Patterns, Techniques & Tools

Here's a breakdown of how to apply these principles:

### 1. Architectural Guardrails (Lightweight & Progressive)

*   **Leverage `DEV.MD` and Layer Definitions:**
    *   **Technique:** Continuously update `DEV.MD` with any architectural shifts, even minor ones. It's your "source of truth" for design intent.
    *   **Technique:** For each layer's main module (e.g., `ElixirScope.AST`, `ElixirScope.CPG`), include a `@moduledoc` that explicitly states:
        *   Its core responsibility.
        *   Which layers it *can* depend on (downwards).
        *   Which layers it *cannot* depend on (upwards or sideways, except through defined integration points).
    *   **Tool/Technique (Later):** Once interfaces are a bit more stable, you could write a custom Mix task that parses `alias` and `import` statements in modules to check for illegal cross-layer dependencies. This is a step towards automated architectural enforcement without full integration tests.

*   **Interface Definition with Behaviours and Protocols:**
    *   **Pattern:** Even if the *implementation* of a module within a layer is changing, define its public API (what other layers will call) using Elixir `behaviour`s.
    *   **Technique:** For cross-layer interactions, especially where multiple implementations might exist (e.g., different AI providers, storage backends), use `protocol`s.
    *   **Benefit:** This forces you to think about the contract first. Implementations can then change without breaking callers, as long as they adhere to the behaviour/protocol. This is a *lightweight contract*.

*   **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs):**
    *   **Tool/Technique:** For significant design choices (like the static/dynamic correlator split), continue creating concise markdown files (like `STATIC_DYNAMIC_CORRELATOR.MD`). Store them in a `docs/adr/` directory.
    *   **Pattern:** Use a simple template: Title, Status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated), Context, Decision, Consequences.
    *   **Benefit:** Documents *why* decisions were made, crucial for a long-lived project with evolving design.

### 2. Code-Level Stability & Clarity

*   **Aggressive Use of Typespecs (`@spec`):**
    *   **Technique:** Add `@spec` to *all* public functions and ideally to private ones too. This is Elixir's strongest tool for immediate clarity and early error detection via Dialyzer.
    *   **Tool:** Run `mix dialyzer` frequently. It might be slow initially on a large codebase, but you can run it on specific paths/modules that are changing. Consider adding it to a pre-commit hook (perhaps in a "warn-only" mode initially if it's too slow).
    *   **Benefit:** Acts as machine-checked documentation and catches many interface mismatches *before* runtime.

*   **REPL-Driven Development & "Smoke" Scripts:**
    *   **Technique:** Lean heavily on `iex -S mix`. As you build or refactor a module, interact with it directly in the REPL.
    *   **Pattern:** The `quick_test.exs` file in your `lib/elixir_scope` is excellent. Encourage more of these. These are not formal tests but quick scripts to exercise a piece of functionality.
        ```elixir
        # lib/elixir_scope/cpg/builder_smoke_test.exs
        IO.puts "--- Running CPG Builder Smoke Test ---"
        alias ElixirScope.AST.Parser
        alias ElixirScope.CPG.Builder

        {:ok, ast} = Parser.parse_string("defmodule Foo, do: def bar, do: 1")
        {:ok, cpg} = Builder.build_from_ast(ast)

        if CPG.has_node?(cpg, {:function, "Foo.bar/0"}) do
          IO.puts "✅ CPG Builder smoke test passed."
        else
          IO.puts "❌ CPG Builder smoke test failed."
          # Optionally raise to make it more obvious
        end
        ```
    *   **Technique:** You can run these via `mix run lib/elixir_scope/cpg/builder_smoke_test.exs`.
    *   **Benefit:** Extremely fast feedback for core pieces of logic without test suite overhead.

*   **Assertions for Invariants (`assert`):**
    *   **Technique:** Within functions, especially during development and refactoring, use `assert` liberally to check preconditions, postconditions, and invariants.
        ```elixir
        def process_node(node, state) do
          assert is_map(node) && Map.has_key?(node, :type)
          # ... logic ...
          new_state = # ...
          assert Map.get(new_state, :processed_nodes) > Map.get(state, :processed_nodes)
          new_state
        end
        ```
    *   **Benefit:** Catches violations of assumptions immediately during development. These can be removed or turned into proper error handling/tests later.

*   **Consistent Formatting and Linting:**
    *   **Tool:** `mix format` is non-negotiable.
    *   **Tool:** `mix credo --strict`. Enforce it. Fix warnings. This significantly improves readability and catches many common issues.
    *   **Benefit:** Reduces cognitive load and makes diffs cleaner.

### 3. Process & Workflow

*   **Frequent, Small, Well-Described Commits/PRs:**
    *   **Technique:** Even for exploratory work, commit frequently to a feature branch.
    *   **Technique:** Pull Requests, even if self-merged initially, are a good place to document *what* changed and *why*. This is especially important when design is shifting.
    *   **Benefit:** Easier to understand changes, revert if necessary, and discuss.

*   **"Spike and Stabilize" Approach:**
    *   **Pattern:** When exploring a new design or a major refactor of a component:
        1.  **Spike:** Create a branch. Rapidly prototype the new design. Don't worry too much about perfect code or full tests. Focus on "does this concept work?" Use REPL and smoke scripts heavily.
        2.  **Stabilize:** If the spike is successful, then:
            *   Clean up the code.
            *   Add robust typespecs.
            *   Ensure Credo/Dialyzer pass.
            *   Start writing more formal unit tests for the now-stabilized interfaces of that component.
            *   Update `DEV.MD` or relevant ADRs.
    *   **Benefit:** Allows for rapid exploration without destabilizing the main development line or investing heavily in tests for code that might be discarded.

*   **Modular Test Structure (Preparing for Formalization):**
    *   **Technique:** Even if you're not writing *all* the tests yet, maintain the test directory structure you already have (unit, integration, etc.).
    *   **Technique:** When a piece of API/logic feels "stable enough," start by adding **unit tests** for it. These are the cheapest and fastest formal tests.
    *   `test/support/fixtures.ex` and `test/support/helpers.ex` are good. As you find yourself repeating setup or assertions in smoke scripts or early unit tests, move that logic into these support modules.
    *   **Benefit:** Reduces friction when you *do* decide to write formal tests.

### 4. When to Start Formalizing Tests More Rigorously

The "100% structure" is a moving target. Don't wait for mythical perfection. Instead, formalize tests when:

1.  **A core component's public API feels stable:** Even if internal implementation details might change, if the way other parts of ElixirScope will interact with it is clear, write unit tests for that API.
2.  **A critical workflow is established:** For example, AST parsing -> CPG basic construction. Even if enhancements are planned, the basic flow needs to be reliable. Start with functional or integration tests for this path.
3.  **You fix a bug:** Always write a test that reproduces the bug before fixing it. This is non-negotiable.
4.  **A component is "done" for the current iteration:** If you've completed a planned set of features for a module/layer and don't expect to touch its core logic for a while, that's a good time to increase its test coverage.
5.  **Before refactoring a *stable* piece of code:** Write tests to characterize its current behavior *before* you change it.

### Tool Summary:

*   **Always On:**
    *   `iex -S mix` (REPL)
    *   `mix format`
    *   `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`
    *   `mix credo --strict`
    *   Your brain (for following `DEV.MD` and architectural principles)
*   **Frequent (Daily/Per-PR):**
    *   `mix dialyzer` (perhaps on changed paths, or accept initial slowness)
    *   Running relevant "smoke scripts" (`mix run ...`)
    *   Writing/updating ADRs for key decisions.
    *   Updating `@moduledoc` and `@doc` with design intent.
    *   Updating `@spec`.
*   **Progressively Introduced:**
    *   Formal unit tests (`mix test.unit`) for stable APIs.
    *   Formal functional/integration tests (`mix test.functional`, `mix test.integration`) for stable workflows.
    *   Custom Mix task for architectural validation (later).

This layered approach to stability allows you to move fast where needed, while progressively hardening the system and ensuring that architectural integrity is maintained without premature over-investment in tests for rapidly changing parts. The key is to make informed decisions about *what* to stabilize and *when*.
