**Statistical Quality Control:**
```elixir
# Performance metrics with documented characteristics
@spec lookup(namespace(), service_name()) :: {:ok, pid()} | :error
# O(1) average case, < 1ms typical latency documented and measured

# Error categorization enables statistical analysis
@error_definitions %{
  {:config, :validation, :invalid_config_value} => {1201, :medium, "msg"},
  {:system, :initialization, :service_unavailable} => {2102, :high, "msg"}
}
```
