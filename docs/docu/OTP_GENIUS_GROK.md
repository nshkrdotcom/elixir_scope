### Prompt 1: Overview of BEAM/OTP Concurrency

"Provide a detailed explanation of the concurrency model in the BEAM virtual machine and OTP framework, emphasizing how it supports high concurrency and fault tolerance in Elixir applications like ElixirScope. Include discussions on lightweight processes, schedulers, the actor model, and how BEAM’s scheduler manages process execution to benefit applications requiring multiple concurrent tasks, such as ElixirScope’s runtime event capture and debugging."

---

### Prompt 2: Processes in ElixirScope

"Describe how ElixirScope utilizes Erlang processes across its 9-layer architecture. Provide specific examples from at least three layers—for instance, the Foundation layer for configuration and event management, the Capture layer for runtime event handling, and the Intelligence layer for AI processing—detailing the purpose of these processes and how they interact to support features like real-time analysis and debugging."

---

### Prompt 3: Message Passing Patterns

"Explain the message passing mechanisms employed in ElixirScope for inter-layer communication, such as between the Capture layer sending runtime events to the Analysis layer. Detail the asynchronous communication patterns, message formats, and strategies for handling message ordering, failures, and high message volumes, ensuring reliability in a debugging and analysis context."

---

### Prompt 4: Supervision Trees

"Outline the supervision tree structure in ElixirScope, identifying key supervisors and the processes they manage, such as `ConfigServer`, `EventStore`, and `TelemetryService` in the Foundation layer. Specify their restart strategies (e.g., `one_for_one`, `rest_for_one`) and explain how this structure enhances system resilience, particularly for maintaining stability during debugging or analysis failures."

---

### Prompt 5: GenServers Usage

"Discuss the role of GenServers in ElixirScope, focusing on their implementation in the Foundation layer for services like `ConfigServer` and `EventStore`. Explain how these GenServers manage state (e.g., configuration data, event logs) and handle concurrent requests, including any mechanisms to prevent race conditions or ensure data consistency under load."

---

### Prompt 6: Tasks and Agents

"Identify and describe specific scenarios in ElixirScope where Tasks or Agents are used for concurrency. For example, are Tasks employed for parallel computations in the Analysis layer to process architectural metrics, or are Agents used in the Capture layer for managing shared state of runtime events? Provide concrete use cases and justify their selection over other concurrency primitives."

---

### Prompt 7: ETS Usage

"If applicable, explain how ElixirScope uses ETS (Erlang Term Storage) for concurrent data storage and retrieval. Specify which layers (e.g., Query, Capture) rely on ETS, the purposes (e.g., caching query results, storing event data), and the concurrency settings (e.g., `read_concurrency`, `write_concurrency`) optimized for ElixirScope’s access patterns."

---

### Prompt 8: Distributed Computing

"Does ElixirScope leverage Distributed Erlang to operate across multiple nodes? If so, describe how it distributes workloads—such as debugging sessions or analysis tasks—and manages concurrency and data consistency in a distributed environment. Address potential use cases like distributed time-travel debugging or large-scale code analysis."

---

### Prompt 9: Concurrency in AI Integration

"In the Intelligence layer, how does ElixirScope use concurrency to handle AI model integrations? Detail how it parallelizes tasks like inference requests, data preprocessing, or result aggregation across processes or nodes, ensuring efficient handling of computationally intensive AI-powered insights."

---

### Prompt 10: Concurrency in Debugging

"Explain how concurrency is managed in the Debugger layer of ElixirScope, particularly for features like time-travel debugging. Describe how the system handles multiple concurrent debugging sessions, ensures access to historical execution data, and avoids interference with the target application’s concurrency."

---

### Prompt 11: Concurrent Access to Graph Data

"In the Graph and CPG (Code Property Graph) layers, how does ElixirScope manage concurrent operations on graph data structures? Since processes are isolated in Elixir, explain how data is shared or synchronized between processes performing simultaneous analyses or queries, ensuring consistency and performance."

---

### Prompt 12: Concurrent Query Execution

"Describe how the Query layer in ElixirScope manages concurrent query executions, as outlined in its advanced querying capabilities. Does it support parallel query processing? If so, detail how it ensures data consistency and optimizes resource utilization when handling multiple queries on large codebases or runtime data."

---

### Prompt 13: Performance Implications

"Analyze the performance benefits and potential bottlenecks of ElixirScope’s concurrency design. Discuss how lightweight processes, asynchronous message passing, and BEAM’s process scheduling enhance scalability and responsiveness for handling large codebases or high event volumes, and identify any concurrency-related optimizations or limitations."

---

### Prompt 14: Concurrency in Target Application Analysis

"Explain how ElixirScope analyzes and interacts with the concurrency features of the target Elixir application it is debugging or analyzing. For instance, how does it trace process communications, monitor supervision trees, or correlate runtime events without disrupting the target application’s concurrency, and what mechanisms ensure non-intrusive operation?"
