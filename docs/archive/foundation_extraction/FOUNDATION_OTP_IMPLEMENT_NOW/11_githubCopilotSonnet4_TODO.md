# ElixirScope Foundation Infrastructure - Missing Features TODO

## Overview

This document details the **missing 15%** of infrastructure features identified in the ElixirScope Foundation implementation analysis. While the core infrastructure is 85% complete with all critical protection patterns implemented, several advanced monitoring and AOP features remain unimplemented.

**Current Implementation Status: 85% Complete**
- ✅ Core Protection Patterns (Circuit Breaker, Rate Limiter, Connection Pooling)
- ✅ Unified Infrastructure Facade
- ✅ Superior Registry Architecture  
- ✅ Full Foundation Integration
- ❌ Custom Monitoring Services (Missing 15%)

---

## 1. Custom Infrastructure Services - NOT IMPLEMENTED (0%)

### 1.1 PerformanceMonitor Service ❌

**Status**: Design exists in docs but not implemented in actual codebase

**Documentation References**:
- `docs/FOUNDATION_OTP_IMPLEMENT_NOW/infrastructure/performance_monitor.ex` (complete design)
- `docs/FOUNDATION_OTP_IMPLEMENT_NOW/10_gemini_plan.md` (architectural overview)

**Detailed Design Found**:
```elixir
# Full GenServer implementation design exists with:
- Module: ElixirScope.Foundation.Infrastructure.PerformanceMonitor
- Metric Types: :latency, :throughput, :error_rate, :resource_usage  
- API Methods: record_latency/4, record_throughput/4, record_error_rate/4

- Alerting: set_alert_threshold/4, check_performance_health/2
- Time Windows: :minute, :hour, :day with aggregations (:avg, :p50, :p95, :p99)
```

**Missing Implementation Features**:
- GenServer for metric collection and aggregation
- Baseline performance calculation algorithms
- Performance alerting system with threshold monitoring
- Integration with telemetry events from other infrastructure components
- Retention and cleanup of historical performance data
- REST/HTTP endpoint exposure for metrics

**Integration Points** (from docs):
- Circuit Breakers, Rate Limiters, Connection Pools send metrics
- Infrastructure facade calls `record_operation_success/failure`
- Example usage: `PerformanceMonitor.record_latency(namespace, [:foundation, :config, :get], 1500, %{cache: :miss})`

## 2. AOP Mixins - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (50%) 

### 2.1 ServiceProtection Mixin ✅ (Design Complete)

**Status**: Complete design exists in infrastructure.ex but not extracted as standalone module

**Documentation References**:
- `docs/FOUNDATION_OTP_IMPLEMENT_NOW/infrastructure.ex` (lines 354-410)

**What Exists**:
```elixir
# Complete mixin design with:
defmodule ElixirScope.Foundation.Infrastructure.ServiceProtection do
  # Macro for automatic protection integration
  # @before_compile hook for adding protection methods
  # protected_call/3 for operation protection
  # infrastructure_health_check/0 integration
  # with_infrastructure_protection/2 macro for declarative protection
end
```

**Missing Implementation**:
- Extract as standalone module file 
- Add to actual codebase (currently only in docs)
- Integration examples and documentation
- Testing and validation

### 2.2 ServiceInstrumentation Mixin ✅ (Design Complete)

## 4. Implementation Priority and Effort Estimates

### Priority 1 - Core Missing Services (High Value)
1. **PerformanceMonitor Service** - ~3-4 days
   - Critical for production monitoring and alerting
   - Required for performance baseline establishment
   
2. **MemoryManager Service** - ~2-3 days  
   - Important for AST layer memory management
   - Prevents OOM conditions in production

### Priority 2 - Health and Monitoring (Medium Value)
3. **HealthAggregator Service** - ~2-3 days
   - Completes the health monitoring ecosystem
   - Enables comprehensive system health visibility

4. **HTTP Health Endpoints** - ~1-2 days
   - Required for production deployment and monitoring
   - Integrates with external monitoring systems

### Priority 3 - Developer Experience (Lower Value)
5. **Extract AOP Mixins** - ~1 day
   - Improves developer ergonomics  
   - Enables declarative protection patterns

**Total Estimated Effort**: 9-13 days to achieve 100% implementation

---

## 5. Recommended Implementation Order

1. **PerformanceMonitor Service** - Highest impact, enables monitoring of existing infrastructure
2. **MemoryManager Service** - Critical for stability, especially with AST layer planned
3. **HealthAggregator Service** - Completes the monitoring triangle with Performance + Memory
4. **HTTP Health Endpoints** - Enables production deployment readiness
5. **Extract AOP Mixins** - Developer experience improvement

---

## 6. Architecture Decisions Needed

### 6.1 HTTP Framework Choice
- **Decision Required**: Choose between Phoenix (full framework) vs Plug (lightweight) for health endpoints
- **Recommendation**: Plug-based for minimal overhead since these are infrastructure endpoints

### 6.2 Metrics Storage
- **Decision Required**: Choose storage backend for PerformanceMonitor metrics
- **Options**: ETS (in-memory), external time-series DB, or hybrid approach
- **Recommendation**: Start with ETS + periodic persistence for simplicity

### 6.3 Memory Management Strategy  
- **Decision Required**: Define memory cleanup strategies and their priorities
- **Recommendation**: Implement pluggable cleanup behaviours for flexibility

---

## 7. Success Criteria for 100% Implementation

- [ ] All 3 custom infrastructure services implemented and tested
- [ ] AOP mixins extracted and integrated into Foundation services  
- [ ] HTTP health endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Full telemetry integration across all components
- [ ] Production-ready monitoring and alerting capabilities
- [ ] Memory management preventing OOM conditions
- [ ] Performance baselines and alerting functional

**Target**: Move from 85% → 100% implementation, completing the ElixirScope Foundation Infrastructure layer as a production-ready, enterprise-grade system.
