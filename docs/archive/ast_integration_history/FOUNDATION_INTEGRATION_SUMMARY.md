# AST Layer Foundation Infrastructure Integration Summary

**Date:** May 2025  
**Documents Updated:** AST_PRD.md v1.1, AST_TECH_SPEC.md v1.1  
**Context:** Integration with Enhanced Foundation Layer Infrastructure Sub-layer

## Overview

Both AST Layer specification documents have been updated to reflect the integration with the new Foundation Layer Infrastructure sub-layer as outlined in `ADDENDEUM_20250604.md`. The Foundation Layer now includes `ElixirScope.Foundation.Infrastructure` components that provide circuit breaking, rate limiting, connection pooling, and sophisticated system-wide resource management.

## Key Integration Points Implemented

### 1. Memory Management Coordination

**AST_PRD.md Changes:**
- **REQ-MEM-006:** Coordinate with Foundation Infrastructure MemoryManager for global memory pressure signals
- **REQ-MEM-007:** Report AST-specific memory usage to Foundation Infrastructure services
- **REQ-PRESS-006:** Respond to global memory pressure signals from Foundation Infrastructure MemoryManager
- **REQ-PRESS-007:** Trigger aggressive cleanup when Foundation Layer signals critical pressure

**AST_TECH_SPEC.md Changes:**
- Enhanced Memory Manager module descriptions to include Foundation coordination
- Added Foundation Infrastructure Integration section detailing memory coordination patterns
- Updated monitoring guidelines to include global memory pressure tracking

### 2. Foundation Infrastructure Coordination Requirements

**New Requirements Added (AST_PRD.md):**
- **REQ-INFRA-001:** Report detailed health status to Foundation Infrastructure HealthAggregator
- **REQ-INFRA-002:** Contribute performance metrics to Foundation Infrastructure PerformanceMonitor
- **REQ-INFRA-003:** Subscribe to global memory pressure signals from Foundation Infrastructure MemoryManager
- **REQ-INFRA-004:** Report AST-specific memory usage to Foundation global memory management
- **REQ-INFRA-005:** Use Foundation Infrastructure protection patterns for high-risk operations when appropriate

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

**AST_PRD.md Changes:**
- **REQ-INT-006:** Handle enhanced Foundation error types from Infrastructure components (circuit breaker open, rate limited, etc.)
- **REL-006:** Handle Foundation Infrastructure error types (circuit breaker open, rate limited, pool timeout)
- **REL-007:** Gracefully degrade when Foundation services are protected by infrastructure components

**AST_TECH_SPEC.md Changes:**
- Enhanced error handling guidelines to include Foundation Infrastructure error types
- Added specific error patterns: `:circuit_breaker_open`, `:rate_limited`, `:pool_checkout_timeout`

### 4. Query System Enhancements

**AST_PRD.md Changes:**
- **REQ-QUERY-006:** Apply rate limiting for complex queries using Foundation Infrastructure components when necessary
- Updated acceptance criteria to include graceful handling of rate-limited scenarios

**AST_TECH_SPEC.md Changes:**
- Enhanced Query Executor specification to include rate limiting capability
- Added Foundation Infrastructure Protection section for query system
- Performance metrics contribution to Foundation Infrastructure PerformanceMonitor

### 5. Health Reporting and Telemetry

**AST_PRD.md Changes:**
- **REQ-INT-007:** Emit standardized telemetry events for Foundation Infrastructure PerformanceMonitor consumption
- **REQ-INT-008:** Implement health check interfaces compatible with Foundation Infrastructure HealthAggregator
- **HEALTH-006:** Implement standardized health check format for Foundation Infrastructure HealthAggregator
- **HEALTH-007:** Report health status with sufficient detail for global system monitoring
- **MON-006:** Emit standardized telemetry events for Foundation Infrastructure consumption
- **MON-007:** Track coordination effectiveness with Foundation Infrastructure services

**AST_TECH_SPEC.md Changes:**
- Added Foundation Infrastructure Coordination section with health check and telemetry specifications
- Defined standard health check return format: `{:ok, %{status: :healthy | :degraded, details: map()}}`
- Specified telemetry event naming conventions: `[:elixir_scope, :ast, :parser, :parse_file_duration]`

### 6. Architecture and Design Principles Updates

**AST_TECH_SPEC.md Changes:**
- Added Foundation Integration as new core design principle
- Enhanced system boundaries description to include Foundation Infrastructure integration
- Updated Memory Efficiency principle to include global memory coordination
- Enhanced Integration Points section with comprehensive Foundation Infrastructure patterns

## Acceptance Criteria Updates

**AST_PRD.md Changes:**
Added three new acceptance criteria:
7. Foundation Infrastructure integration requirements (REQ-INFRA-*) are validated
8. Global memory coordination functions correctly under pressure scenarios  
9. Health reporting and telemetry integration with Foundation Infrastructure services operates as expected

## Testing Requirements Impact

Both documents now include enhanced testing requirements:
- Foundation Infrastructure coordination testing
- Memory pressure response validation with global signals
- Integration testing with Foundation Infrastructure services
- Validation of health reporting and telemetry integration

## Configuration Enhancements

**AST_TECH_SPEC.md Changes:**
- Added Foundation Infrastructure coordination parameters to configuration guidelines
- Enhanced monitoring guidelines to include Foundation Infrastructure coordination metrics

## Benefits of Integration

1. **Enhanced Reliability:** AST Layer benefits from more resilient Foundation services
2. **Global Resource Management:** Better memory coordination across the entire system
3. **Improved Observability:** Standardized health checks and telemetry integration
4. **Selective Protection:** Ability to use Foundation Infrastructure components for specific high-risk operations
5. **Graceful Degradation:** Better handling of system-wide pressure and failures

## Implementation Priorities

Based on the addendum, the following integration points should be prioritized:

1. **Health Reporting Interface:** Implement standardized health checks for all major AST GenServers
2. **Memory Coordination:** Enhance AST Memory Manager to coordinate with Foundation Infrastructure MemoryManager
3. **Telemetry Integration:** Implement standardized telemetry events for Foundation Infrastructure consumption
4. **Error Handling:** Update error handling to manage Foundation Infrastructure error types
5. **Query Protection:** Implement selective rate limiting for resource-intensive queries

## Next Steps

1. Implement health check interfaces for core AST components
2. Enhance Memory Manager with Foundation Infrastructure coordination
3. Update error handling throughout AST Layer for Foundation Infrastructure error types
4. Implement telemetry event emission with standardized naming conventions
5. Test integration with Foundation Infrastructure services under various scenarios
