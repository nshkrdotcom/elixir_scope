Okay, let's delve into the concurrency aspects of ElixirScope's more interactive and advanced layers.

## ElixirScope Concurrency: Runtime Interaction & Advanced Features

These layers are where ElixirScope interacts with running applications, external services (like LLMs), and user-driven debugging sessions. Effective concurrency management here is crucial for responsiveness, low overhead, and handling potentially massive data streams.

### 1. Capture Layer (Runtime Correlation & Querying)

The Capture layer is responsible for instrumenting target applications, collecting runtime events, and correlating them with static analysis data.

*   **Instrumentation & Event Collection:**
    *   **Low-Overhead Instrumentation:** Instrumentation points (e.g., inserted by ElixirScope into Phoenix controllers, Ecto queries, or around `GenServer` callbacks in the target application) must be extremely lightweight. The code injected should do minimal work, primarily capturing essential data (PID, module, function, args, timestamp, relevant context) and dispatching it *asynchronously*.
    *   **Asynchronous Event Dispatch:**
        *   From an instrumented function, an event could be sent to a dedicated collector `GenServer` within ElixirScope using `GenServer.cast/2`. This ensures the instrumented code doesn't wait for event processing.
        *   Alternatively, for extremely high-frequency events, a `Task.start/1` could be used to send the message, further isolating the dispatch from the instrumented process's reduction count for that specific call.
    *   **Batching:** A collector `GenServer` (or a pool of them if sharded by, e.g., target application node or PID range) would receive these raw events. It would buffer them into batches and periodically (or when a batch size is reached) send the batch to the `EventStore`.
        ```elixir
        defmodule ElixirScope.Capture.EventCollector do
          use GenServer
          alias ElixirScope.Foundation.Services.EventStore # Or via Foundation.Events API

          defstart_link(opts) do
            GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, opts, name: Keyword.get(opts, :name))
          end

          @impl GenServer
          def init(opts) do
            batch_size = Keyword.get(opts, :batch_size, 100)
            flush_interval = Keyword.get(opts, :flush_interval_ms, 50)
            Process.send_after(self(), :flush_batch, flush_interval)
            {:ok, %{buffer: [], batch_size: batch_size, flush_interval: flush_interval}}
          end

          # Called from instrumented code (via a thin client)
          def record_event(collector_pid, event_data) do
            GenServer.cast(collector_pid, {:raw_event, event_data})
          end

          @impl GenServer
          def handle_cast({:raw_event, event_data}, state) do
            new_buffer = [event_data | state.buffer]
            if length(new_buffer) >= state.batch_size do
              # Assume create_events_from_raw builds proper Event structs
              events_to_store = create_events_from_raw(Enum.reverse(new_buffer))
              :ok = EventStore.store_batch(events_to_store) # Using call for backpressure
              {:noreply, %{state | buffer: []}}
            else
              {:noreply, %{state | buffer: new_buffer}}
            end
          end

          @impl GenServer
          def handle_info(:flush_batch, state) do
            if Enum.any?(state.buffer) do
              events_to_store = create_events_from_raw(Enum.reverse(state.buffer))
              :ok = EventStore.store_batch(events_to_store)
            end
            Process.send_after(self(), :flush_batch, state.flush_interval)
            {:noreply, %{state | buffer: []}}
          end
          # ... other helpers, e.g., create_events_from_raw ...
        end
        ```
    *   **Sampling:** If event volume is too high, sampling strategies (e.g., probabilistic, head/tail-based for function calls) can be configured either at the instrumentation points or within the `EventCollector`.

*   **Event Correlation:**
    Correlating runtime events (e.g., a function call with arguments `{MyApp.UserView, :render, ["show.html", %{user: ...}], <pid>, <timestamp>}`) with static CPG nodes can be computationally non-trivial.
    *   This can be offloaded to a pool of worker `Task`s supervised by a `Task.Supervisor`. The `EventCollector`, after creating basic `Event` structs, could dispatch batches of these to correlation tasks.
    *   Each task would take an event (or batch), query the CPG (likely an ETS-backed store for fast reads), find the corresponding static code elements, enrich the event (e.g., adding CPG node IDs), and then forward it to the `EventStore`.
    *   A `GenStage` pipeline could be: Raw Instrumented Data -> `EventCollectorStage` (batching) -> `CorrelationStage` (worker pool) -> `EventStoreStage` (storage).

*   **Storage and Backpressure:**
    *   Events from `EventCollector`s (or `CorrelationStage`) flow to the `EventStore` in the Foundation Layer, likely via `ElixirScope.Foundation.Events.store_batch/1`.
    *   Using `GenServer.call/3` for `store_batch` provides backpressure: the collector process will wait if the `EventStore` is busy. This is crucial to prevent overwhelming the `EventStore`.
    *   If the capture rate consistently exceeds `EventStore`'s capacity even with batching, the `EventCollector`'s buffer will grow. It needs a strategy (e.g., dropping older events in its buffer, signaling back to instrumentation to reduce event rate via sampling, or even temporarily stopping capture for certain sources).

*   **"Runtime Correlation" Feature:**
    When a runtime event is captured (e.g., function call, process spawn):
    1.  The `Capture` layer receives the raw event data.
    2.  A dedicated process/task takes this event. It extracts identifiers like `{Module, Function, Arity}` or PID.
    3.  It queries the CPG (which contains static analysis info, mapping MFAs and other constructs to CPG nodes). This CPG data is likely in an ETS table for fast concurrent reads.
    4.  The runtime event is enriched with references (e.g., CPG node IDs) to the static structures.
    5.  This enriched event (containing both runtime specifics and static code links) is then sent to the `EventStore`. This allows queries to join live behavior with code structure.

### 2. Query Layer (Advanced Querying)

The Query layer enables complex queries over the data collected by ElixirScope, potentially joining static (CPG, AST) and dynamic (runtime events) information.

*   **Concurrent Complex Query Execution:**
    A query like "Find all function calls in module `X` that, at runtime, frequently accessed a specific Ecto schema field `Y` and had an average duration greater than 100ms" involves:
    1.  Static CPG traversal: Identify calls in module `X`.
    2.  Runtime event filtering: Find Ecto query events related to schema field `Y` and filter by duration.
    3.  Joining: Link the CPG call sites to the runtime Ecto events.
    A `QueryEngine` (likely a `GenServer` orchestrating the query) can execute these parts concurrently.
    ```elixir
    defmodule ElixirScope.Query.Engine do
      use GenServer
      # ...

      @impl GenServer
      def handle_call({:execute_complex_query, query_ast}, _from, state) do
        # 1. Decompose query_ast into sub-queries
        {static_sub_query, runtime_sub_query, join_conditions} = decompose(query_ast)

        # 2. Execute sub-queries concurrently
        static_task = Task.async(fn -> query_cpg_store(static_sub_query) end)
        runtime_task = Task.async(fn -> ElixirScope.Foundation.Events.query(runtime_sub_query) end)

        # Await results
        static_results = Task.await(static_task, @timeout)
        runtime_results = Task.await(runtime_task, @timeout)

        # 3. Perform join and final processing
        case {static_results, runtime_results} do
          {{:ok, s_res}, {:ok, r_res}} ->
            final_result = perform_join_and_filter(s_res, r_res, join_conditions)
            {:reply, {:ok, final_result}, state}
          _ ->
            {:reply, {:error, :sub_query_failed}, state}
        end
      end
      # ...
    end
    ```

*   **Parallel Sub-queries:** As shown above, `Task.async/await` is suitable for running independent parts of a query plan (e.g., fetching CPG data and runtime event data separately before joining). The concurrency here is limited by the number of independent branches in the query plan.

### 3. Intelligence Layer (AI/ML Integration)

This layer integrates with LLMs and potentially local ML models for advanced insights.

*   **LLM Calls (I/O-Bound):**
    API calls to services like OpenAI are network-bound and can have variable latency.
    *   A dedicated `GenServer` (e.g., `LLMRequestManager`) should manage these. It would maintain a queue of outgoing requests and a pool of worker `Task`s (supervised by a `Task.Supervisor`) to execute the actual HTTP calls.
    *   The `LLMRequestManager` can enforce concurrency limits (e.g., max 5 concurrent calls to OpenAI to respect rate limits), handle API key management, implement retries with backoff, and transform responses.
        ```elixir
        defmodule ElixirScope.Intelligence.LLMRequestManager do
          use GenServer
          # Max concurrent requests to the LLM provider
          @max_concurrent_requests 5
          # Name for Task.Supervisor specific to these LLM tasks
          @task_supervisor_name ElixirScope.Intelligence.LLMTaskSupervisor

          def start_link(opts) do
            # Ensure Task.Supervisor is started, e.g., in Intelligence.Application
            GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, opts, name: __MODULE__)
          end

          # Public API
          def request_ai_insight(prompt_data) do
            GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:request, prompt_data}, :infinity)
          end

          @impl GenServer
          def init(_opts) do
            # Queue for pending requests, map for active tasks by monitor reference
            {:ok, %{queue: :queue.new(), active_tasks: %{}, available_slots: @max_concurrent_requests}}
          end

          @impl GenServer
          def handle_call({:request, prompt_data}, from, state) do
            if state.available_slots > 0 do
              # Dispatch immediately
              start_llm_task(prompt_data, from, state)
            else
              # Queue the request
              new_queue = :queue.in({prompt_data, from}, state.queue)
              {:noreply, %{state | queue: new_queue}} # Caller will wait
            end
          end

          @impl GenServer
          def handle_info({:DOWN, ref, :process, _pid, reason}, state) do
            # Task completed or crashed
            {original_caller, new_active_tasks} = Map.pop(state.active_tasks, ref)
            new_state = %{state | active_tasks: new_active_tasks, available_slots: state.available_slots + 1}

            # Reply to original caller if task finished (reason determines success/failure)
            GenServer.reply(original_caller, decode_task_reason(reason))

            # Process next from queue if any
            process_next_from_queue(new_state)
          end

          defp start_llm_task(prompt_data, caller, state) do
            task = Task.Supervisor.async_nolink(@task_supervisor_name, fn ->
              # Actual HTTP call to LLM provider using prompt_data
              HTTPoison.post("llm_api_endpoint", Jason.encode!(prompt_data), headers())
              |> handle_llm_response()
            end)
            new_active_tasks = Map.put(state.active_tasks, task.ref, caller)
            {:noreply, %{state | active_tasks: new_active_tasks, available_slots: state.available_slots - 1}}
          end

          defp process_next_from_queue(state) do
            if state.available_slots > 0 and not :queue.is_empty(state.queue) do
              {{:value, {prompt_data, caller}}, new_queue} = :queue.out(state.queue)
              start_llm_task(prompt_data, caller, %{state | queue: new_queue})
            else
              {:noreply, state} # No change if no slots or queue empty
            end
          end
          # ... helpers like handle_llm_response, decode_task_reason ...
        end
        ```

*   **Local Model Inference (CPU-Intensive):**
    If ElixirScope uses local ML models (e.g., for simpler pattern matching or code smell detection that doesn't require full LLM capabilities):
    *   These tasks should run in a separate pool of worker processes (e.g., a pool of `GenServer`s or `Task`s managed by a `Task.Supervisor`). This isolates their CPU usage from the main application and other ElixirScope layers.
    *   The number of workers can be configured based on available cores. BEAM schedulers will pre-empt these tasks, but isolating them makes management cleaner.

*   **"AI-Powered Analysis" / "AI Debugging Assistance" Concurrency:**
    *   Multiple users or automated triggers (like code change analysis) can request AI insights. Each request is a distinct job.
    *   The `LLMRequestManager` (or a similar orchestrator for local models) naturally handles concurrent requests by queueing them if necessary and dispatching them to worker tasks as capacity allows. This ensures that the system remains responsive and external API rate limits are respected, even under concurrent demand.

### 4. Debugger Layer (Sessions, Breakpoints, Time Travel)

This layer manages interactive debugging sessions, breakpoints, and advanced features like time-travel debugging.

*   **Multiple Debug Sessions:**
    *   Each active debug session should be managed by its own `GenServer` process (e.g., `ElixirScope.Debugger.SessionManager`). This `GenServer` would hold the state for that specific session:
        *   Target PIDs/modules being debugged.
        *   Set breakpoints.
        *   Current execution pointer (for stepping).
        *   Watch expressions and their current values.
        *   A reference to the relevant portion of the time-travel history.
    *   These `SessionManager` `GenServer`s would be dynamically supervised, likely by a `Supervisor` using a `:simple_one_for_one` strategy, allowing sessions to be started and stopped independently.

*   **Event Handling during Debugging:**
    *   A `SessionManager` for an active debug session would subscribe to relevant runtime events (e.g., function calls, state changes) from the `Capture` layer, specifically filtered for its target PIDs/modules.
    *   When a breakpoint is hit (an event matching a breakpoint condition is received), the `SessionManager` coordinates pausing (if applicable, though true "pausing" in BEAM is nuanced; more likely it signals related processes or enters a specific receive loop), collects context, and communicates with the debugger UI.
    *   Event processing for a debug session runs concurrently with the target application's execution. The target application emits events, and the `SessionManager` consumes them from its mailbox.

*   **Time-Travel Debugging:**
    *   **Concurrent State Management:** This is the most demanding feature.
        *   The `Capture` layer needs to persist not just events but also sufficient information to reconstruct process states at various points in time (e.g., full state snapshots periodically, or state deltas alongside events). This data goes to the `EventStore`.
        *   A `SessionManager` in a time-travel session would query the `EventStore` (or a specialized historical state service) for events and state information within a specific time window or around a particular event.
        *   Reconstructing a historical state (e.g., "show me the state of PID X just before event Y") might involve replaying events and state changes. This reconstruction should be done in a separate `Task` spawned by the `SessionManager` to avoid blocking UI interactions.
    *   **Querying Historical States:** Queries against historical data are I/O and potentially CPU-intensive. They must not block the `EventStore` from ingesting new live events or other live debug sessions. Read-replicas or specialized query engines for historical data might be necessary if performance becomes an issue.
    *   **`max_history_size`:** This is primarily a concern for the `EventStore` and its pruning/archival strategy. The Debugger layer influences this by defining how far back users might want to "travel."

*   **Live Code Intelligence / Real-time analysis as you code:**
    *   A dedicated `GenServer` (e.g., `ElixirScope.EditorIntegration.CodeWatcher`) could monitor file system events (using a library like `Kaisen` or `FileSystem`) in the user's project.
    *   Upon detecting a change in a relevant file:
        1.  It debounces changes to avoid excessive re-analysis during rapid typing.
        2.  It spawns a `Task` (under a `Task.Supervisor`) to perform a quick re-parse of the changed file (AST layer) and incremental update of the relevant CPG parts.
        3.  Another `Task` might then run lightweight analyses (e.g., syntax checks, quick smell detection) on the updated CPG.
        4.  Results are pushed to the editor/IDE via an appropriate communication channel (e.g., Language Server Protocol).
    *   These background tasks must run with lower OTP process priority (if significant CPU is used, though less common for incremental analysis) or be designed to yield frequently to ensure editor responsiveness and other ElixirScope functions are not impacted.

Managing these layers involves a delicate balance of isolating concurrent operations in processes (`GenServer`, `Task`), using asynchronous messaging (`cast`, `send`) for decoupling and responsiveness, employing OTP supervision for fault tolerance, and implementing backpressure mechanisms where high-volume data streams meet potentially slower processing stages. The choice of `GenServer.call` vs. `GenServer.cast` or `Task.Supervisor` vs. a persistent `GenServer` pool depends heavily on the specific requirements for data consistency, acknowledgement, and the nature (CPU-bound vs. I/O-bound) of the work.
